            <h2> In the depths of memory, she lingers still
                you are  my heart's sweet thrill.
                Malak, a name that echoes in my mind,
                A gem of a girl, rare and refined...
                
                your laughter dances like jellyfish in waves 
               , Quiet and calm, yet a storm within,
                Her gaze, a spell I've long been in....
                
                Oh, how she shines with those brown eyes,
                Each glance, a tale of love's sweet ties.
                Her quirks and charms, a symphony rare,
                In her presence, life feels fair....
                
                Even in anger, she's a sight to behold,
                A mix of frustration, but she look sweet  untold.
                Her jealousy, a sign of passion's fire,
                A trait that only adds to her entire...........
                
                I long to turn back to time to make thing right
                To mend the wounds, to let love grow.
                For Malak 
                my heart decree
                A chance to win you back, oh let it be....
                
                In dreams, I see your smile so bright,
                Guiding me through the darkest night.
                With hope in my heart, I'll make my plea,
                For you,  </h2></div>
